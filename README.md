# Conway's Game of Life

## Background:
Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton originally created by John Conway in 1970. The game is a zero-player game where cells interact with eachother by abiding to four rules. Thus, the outcome of the game is predetermined by the initial configuration of what cells are alive and dead.

### Rules of the game:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## Description:
This is a simulation of John Conway's Game of Life using the pygame module in Python.

## How to use:
- The menu offers two configurations (random or custom)
- To place cells in custom, simply click and hold with your left mouse button, once complete click done at the top left
- Press up arrow key to turn up FPS, Press down arrow key to turn down FPS
- Left and right arrow keys scroll through cell colors
- Press space bar to pause / unpause
